# FLODT-Cheat-Sheet
Just two renpy scripts to add some basic transform functions and provide a cheat sheet for easy copy-pasting

Paste these rpy files literally anywhere inside the "game" folder inside your FLODT game files

This adds: twitch and jump transformations for character sprites, camera and 3d space initialization to allow z-axis movement, some copy-paste templates for moving a character on-screen and offscreen without just dissolving, new "extra" layer and rearranging of layer tags, and finally developer mode.
The installation of this mod does not edit any existing game files, only allows "simpler" development
